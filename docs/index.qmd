# Introduction

## Project Description:-

1.  The objective of this project will be analyzing and interpreting the raw borehole repair data to improve decision making.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
borehole <- read_csv(here::here("data/raw/borehole_repair_data.csv"))
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
